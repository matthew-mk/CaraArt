# CaraArt

This is an individual project that I created as part of the "CS312 - Web Applications Development" course at the University of Strathclyde.

This project involved building a website for the company CaraArt to create an online presence where they could exhibit and sell their paintings. It includes an art listings page which displays 12 paintings per page through the use of pagination. The paintings are displayed dynamically by extracting data about each painting from a database table. Each painting has an associated button that can be pressed to take the user to a page which provides detailed information about that specific painting. There are forms for ordering paintings and also for booking appointments at the art gallery, both of which are connected to a database table that stores the information that is submitted within these forms. There is an admin page where all of this stored information can be viewed.

The languages that I used to build this website were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL.
